      <description>A few days ago I faced an issue that was reported to me by one of the beta testers. It was a crash, in the production version, After a lot of struggling with code, I couldnâ€™t reproduce the crash. I understood the problem might be with cached data, I needed to extract the cached data of the installed application (sandbox).
There are some ways to do that:   Root the device and access the sandbox easily with file explorer applications or anything else.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>
