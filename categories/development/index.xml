      <description>A few days ago I faced an issue that was reported to me by one of the beta testers. It was a crash, in the production version, After a lot of struggling with code, I couldnâ€™t reproduce the crash.

There are some ways to do that:   Root the device and access the sandbox easily with file explorer applications or anything else.</description>

If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>
